/* Challenge 1: Let's say you're building Reddit. Only users that are either moderators or have reached a certain karma threshold are allowed to upvote. */

const karma = 130;
const isModerator = true;

// first use a ternary to set hasEnoughKarma to true if karma is above 100. If not, set it to false
let hasEnoughKarma = karma > 100 ? true : false;

//  set the value of canUpvote with short-circuiting (using hasEnoughKarma and isModerator)
let canUpvote = isModerator ||Â hasEnoughKarma;

console.log("canUpvote:", canUpvote);


/* Challenge 2: Let's say that only moderators who have enough karma are allowed to delete posts.  How would you set the canDelete variable */

// set canDelete to true if both hasEnoughKarma and isModerator is true

// Challenge 3: what is the value of user? What if you switch the hasValidEmail variable to false? What if the response is empty?
