// Challenge: The recommendations object contains a set of of nice places to visit in Brighton, UK,
// organized by what you'd like to do (eat pancakes, drink coffee etc).

// 1. Destructure the places to drink (coffee and beer) from recommendations
// 2. Destructure the places to listen to music
// 3. Write a function that takes the recommendations object as an argument and that
//      a) Logs out the music venues in recommendations when invoked 
//      b) Uses object descructuring to get the "traditional" and "jazz" keys from the argument

const recommendations = {
    pancakes: 'Nowhere Man',

    music: { 
        traditional: 'Fiddler\'s Elbow', 
        jazz: 'The Paris House'
    }
}

const { beer, coffe } = recommendations;

const { music: { traditional, jazz } } = recommendations;
