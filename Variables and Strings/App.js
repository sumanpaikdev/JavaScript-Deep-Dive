// variables in javascript

var username; //declaration
username = "suman" // initialization

// rules of creating variables in javascript

// 1. name only contain letters, numbers, symbols $ _
// 2. first character of the variable must not a number

var firstname-;  // this is invalid variables because of " - "
var 3lastname; // this is also a invalid because it contains number at the first position

// in javascript we ues camel case conversion 
var firstName;
var lastName;


// "var" is a reserve keyword and we can't use it as a variable name
var var; // this is wrong bacause var is a reserved keyword
